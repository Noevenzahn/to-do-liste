# To do React App with Firestore and Firebase Auth
This Project is my first fullstack application. 
I created it during my internship at a local software company. 

### Some of its features:
- Email and password login
- Assigning other users to a task via email
- Editing tasks directly (just click on it)
- marking task as complete
